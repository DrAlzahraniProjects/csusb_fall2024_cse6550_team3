## Installation

### Base Image

We use  `python:3.10-slim`  as the base image for our Docker container. This lightweight image is derived from the official Python images, specifically optimized for smaller sizes and faster performance.
```
FROM python:3.10-slim
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
```

*Figure 1: The base image python:3.10-slim used for the Docker container.*

#### Benefits of Using a Slim Base Image

Benefits of Using a Slim Base Image
Size Efficiency: Slim images are significantly smaller than their full-sized counterparts, resulting in reduced download times when pulling the image from a container registry. This is particularly advantageous in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, where build times are critical. A smaller image size not only speeds up the initial pull but also reduces the overall storage requirements, which can lead to cost savings in cloud environments. Moreover, smaller images can be transferred more quickly between different environments, enhancing development agility.

Enhanced Security: With fewer packages included in a slim image, there is a reduced risk of vulnerabilities. A smaller attack surface means that fewer potential security issues exist, making it easier to manage security patches. By minimizing the number of dependencies and components, the likelihood of encountering security vulnerabilities is also decreased. This focus on essential components allows for more straightforward auditing and compliance processes, enabling teams to maintain a stronger security posture throughout the application lifecycle.

Speed of Deployment: Containers based on slim images start up faster than those based on larger images, which is especially important for applications that require rapid scaling in cloud environments. The reduced overhead allows for quicker provisioning of containers, enabling more efficient resource utilization. This rapid deployment capability is crucial for microservices architectures and serverless applications, where responsiveness and agility are vital. Additionally, faster startup times can lead to improved user experiences, as applications can respond to requests more promptly.

Simplicity and Maintainability: Slim base images promote a simpler architecture by including only the necessary components to run applications. This simplicity not only streamlines the development process but also makes the images easier to maintain. Developers can focus on the core functionalities of their applications without the added complexity of unnecessary packages. This leads to clearer documentation and easier onboarding for new team members, as they can quickly understand the structure and dependencies of the application without wading through extraneous information.

Environment Consistency: Utilizing slim base images helps ensure that the development and production environments remain consistent. Since slim images are designed to include only essential packages, they minimize discrepancies that could arise from additional software or dependencies present in larger images. This consistency reduces the risk of encountering environment-specific bugs, allowing developers to spend more time building features and less time troubleshooting deployment issues.

### Install System Dependencies

To prepare the environment for running NeMo, we need to install essential system dependencies. This includes tools necessary for downloading additional files and managing the environment.

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102e5a11-d871-46b6-97d4-72e0d2928a41)

*Figure 2: Installing system dependencies using apt-get in the Docker container.*

#### Explanation of Each Command

apt-get update: This command updates the list of available packages and their versions from the repositories configured on the system. It’s crucial to run this command before any package installations to ensure you are getting the latest versions of the packages available in the repositories. By fetching the latest package information, you help prevent issues that could arise from outdated dependencies, ensuring a smoother installation process and minimizing potential conflicts with already installed software. Running this command regularly can also help you stay informed about any available security updates and enhancements for the packages you use.

apt-get install -y wget: The -y option automatically answers "yes" to any prompts during installation, ensuring the command executes without manual intervention. This is particularly useful for automated scripts where user interaction is not feasible. wget is a utility for downloading files from the web, supporting HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. It is often used to retrieve datasets or other resources during the build process, making it an essential tool for fetching files required for your application or environment setup. Additionally, wget can resume interrupted downloads and handle recursive downloads, making it versatile for downloading complex file structures or large datasets efficiently.
### Install NeMo

Once the base image and system dependencies are in place, we proceed to install the NeMo toolkit along with all its dependencies:

```
RUN pip install nemo_toolkit[all]
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264c5c53-f415-4cc2-bb84-c0622ecfc253)

*Figure 3: Installing the NeMo toolkit and its dependencies using pip.*

#### Understanding the NeMo Toolkit

-   **What is NeMo?**  NeMo (NVIDIA Neural Modules) is an open-source toolkit developed by NVIDIA that provides components for building conversational AI models. It enables users to design, train, and deploy models with ease, making it suitable for various applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech synthesis.
-   **Why is NeMo Beneficial?**  NeMo supports a modular architecture, allowing users to combine various components, such as encoders and decoders, to create complex models without starting from scratch. The toolkit comes with pre-trained models, which users can fine-tune for their specific tasks, saving considerable time and computational resources.

## Configuration

### Set Environment Variables

After installing the necessary software, we need to configure our environment for optimal operation. One of the first steps is setting environment variables that NeMo will utilize during its runtime.
```
ENV NEMO_DATA_PATH=/data
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4132ea80-dd7b-4d21-b93c-190e456c6f06)

*Figure 4: Setting environment variables for NeMo, specifying the data path.*

#### Importance of Environment Variables

-   **NEMO_DATA_PATH**: This variable specifies the path where the data used by NeMo will be stored. By setting this variable, you help the toolkit locate the necessary datasets and files during model training and evaluation.

### Additional Environment Variables

In addition to  `NEMO_DATA_PATH`, you might want to define additional environment variables that can enhance the configuration:
```
ENV NEMO_MODEL_PATH=/models
ENV NEMO_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

#### Explanation of Additional Variables

-   **NEMO_MODEL_PATH**: This variable points to the directory where trained models can be saved or loaded from. This separation helps maintain an organized structure within your container, making it easier to manage model files.
-   **NEMO_LOG_LEVEL**: This variable controls the verbosity of the logs produced by NeMo. By setting it to  `INFO`, you can receive detailed logging information during execution, which is beneficial for monitoring and debugging.

### Optional Configuration

To enhance the container further, consider setting additional environment variables related to hardware usage and performance tuning. For example, you might want to configure GPU settings or memory management options if your application requires it.
```
ENV CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

#### Explanation of the CUDA Variable

-   **CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES**: This variable controls which GPUs are accessible to the application running in the container. By setting this variable, you can ensure that your application uses the appropriate GPU resources available in the host machine.

## Implementation

### Create Directory Structure

A well-defined directory structure is critical for managing files and resources effectively. We create necessary directories to organize data and application code.
```
RUN mkdir -p /data /app
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1b9dee1-d52c-4817-803d-a7176bf184a2)

*Figure 5: Creating a structured directory layout for data and application code.*

#### Benefits of a Structured Directory Layout

-   **Clarity**: Organizing files into specific directories helps maintain clarity, especially as the number of files and resources grows. This makes it easier for developers and operators to locate necessary files quickly.
-   **Scalability**: A good directory structure can scale with the project. As your project evolves, adding new features or datasets can be done seamlessly without disrupting the existing organization.
-   **Maintainability**: With a clear directory structure, it becomes easier to maintain and update files, reducing the likelihood of errors during development or deployment.

### Copy Configuration Files

Next, we need to copy any configuration files required by NeMo Curator into the appropriate directory in the container:
```
COPY config.yaml /app/config.yaml
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28914ed-4f88-4364-ba1a-33c8cec6ca5e)

*Figure 6: Copying configuration files into the container for NeMo.*

#### Why Use Configuration Files?

-   **Flexibility**: Configuration files allow you to easily change settings without modifying the application code. This separation of configuration from code enhances flexibility and maintainability.
-   **Version Control**: Keeping configuration files in version control enables tracking of changes over time, making it easier to revert to previous settings if necessary.

### Example Configuration File

A simple example of a configuration file (`config.yaml`) for an ASR model might look like this:
```
model:
  type: "ASRModel"
  params:
    sample_rate: 16000
    num_classes: 29
    pretrained_model: "nemo:speech_to_text"
   ```

#### Explanation of Configuration Parameters

-   **model.type**: Specifies the type of model being used. In this case, it is an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model.
-   **model.params**: Contains parameters specific to the model. For example,  `sample_rate`  sets the audio sample rate, and  `num_classes`  defines the number of output classes for the model's predictions.

## Usage

### Running NeMo Curator

Once everything is set up, you can run NeMo Curator by executing a command tailored to your specific model and task (e.g., ASR model):
```
python -m nemo.collections.asr.models.automatic_speech_recognition --config-path /app/config.yaml
```

#### Understanding the Execution Command

-   **-m**: This flag instructs Python to run a module as a script. The specified module is the ASR model within the NeMo toolkit.
-   **--config-path**: This argument allows you to specify the path to your configuration file, ensuring that NeMo has all the necessary parameters to execute your task effectively.

#### Running a Sample Model for Speech Recognition

To demonstrate NeMo’s capabilities, we’ll walk through a usage example using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. This example assumes you have a dataset ready at /data for training or testing. Follow these steps:

Prepare the Configuration File: Update config.yaml with paths relevant to your dataset and adjust model parameters as needed. For example:

```
model:
  type: "ASRModel"
  params:
    sample_rate: 16000
    num_classes: 29
    pretrained_model: "nemo:speech_to_text"
dataset:
  path: "/data/audio_files"
  labels: "/data/labels.txt"
```

#### Run the ASR Model:
Use the following command to run the ASR model with the updated configuration file:
```
python -m nemo.collections.asr.models.automatic_speech_recognition --config-path /app/config.yaml
```

This command will start processing audio files in /data/audio_files and save the model’s outputs to the specified output directory. This example demonstrates how to apply NeMo’s ASR capabilities to your dataset.

#### Example Output and Verification

To verify the output, check the results generated by the ASR model in the specified directory. Here’s a sample snippet showing expected output:
```
Transcription Results:
1. "Audio file 1": "Transcribed text for audio file 1..."
2. "Audio file 2": "Transcribed text for audio file 2..."
```

Using this output, you can measure model accuracy and performance on your specific dataset.


#### Running a sample for Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model

Running a NeMo model for text-to-speech synthesis can be useful for applications that require generating spoken audio from text input. Below is a step-by-step guide:

Prepare the Configuration File: Update config.yaml with parameters relevant to the TTS model. An example configuration might look like this:

```
model:
  type: "TTSModel"
  params:
    sample_rate: 22050
    pretrained_model: "nemo:tts_en_ljspeech"
dataset:
  text: "/data/input_text.txt"
  output_audio: "/data/output_audio"
```

### Run the TTS Model:

Execute the following command to run the TTS model with the updated configuration file:

```
python -m nemo.collections.tts.models.text_to_speech --config-path /app/config.yaml
```
Expected Output: This command generates audio files in the specified output directory based on the text provided in input_text.txt. Check the output directory for generated audio files.

### Expose Ports

To allow communication between your application and external systems, it's essential to expose the necessary ports. If you are running a server or API, include the following command:

```
EXPOSE 5003
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b520ec18-2838-4645-b413-877facb09608)

-   **Client Access**: Exposing ports allows external clients to communicate with the application running inside the container. This is especially important for web applications or APIs that need to interact with other services.
-   **Documentation**: The  `EXPOSE`  command serves as a form of documentation, indicating which ports are intended to be published when the container is run. This can be helpful for users or developers working with the container.

### Running the Application

To execute your application using Python, specify the entry point and command to run the application:
```
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b357b6cc-fc27-4884-a1e1-09f26b4ac5e0)

*Figure 8: Setting the default command for the container to run the ASR model.*

#### Explanation of ENTRYPOINT and CMD

-   **ENTRYPOINT**: This command defines the primary executable that will run when the container starts. In this case, we set it to  `python`, ensuring that the Python interpreter is always used to run our application.
-   **CMD**: This command specifies the default parameters for the  `ENTRYPOINT`. Here, we set  `app.py`  as the default script to run, which can be overridden at runtime if needed.

### Running the Container

To run the container based on your Dockerfile, use the following command:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 5003:5003 team3-app
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3a86909-ac42-46b7-bfae-6201cb3ab082)

*Figure 9: Command to run the Docker container.*

#### Explanation of the Run Command

-   **-it**: This flag runs the container in interactive mode, allowing you to interact with it directly through the terminal.
-   **--rm**: This option automatically removes the container when it exits, which is useful for keeping your environment clean, especially during development.
