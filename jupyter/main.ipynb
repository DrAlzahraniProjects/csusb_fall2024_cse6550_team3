    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: This chatbot is as an educational tool that's built to answer questions related to the textbook, [Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering). The chatbot was built by team 3 for [CSE 6550: Software Engineering Concepts](https://catalog.csusb.edu/coursesaz/cse/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: In this notebook, we will demonstrate how the chatbot uses retrieval augemented generation (RAG) to answer questions using the SWEBOK textbook as the primary data source.\n",

    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "Github, Docker, Mamba, Python, Jupyter Notebook\n",
