 Software Engineering is the systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves applying engineering principles such as modularity, abstraction, and reusability to create high-quality, reliable, efficient, and maintainable software systems. The process typically includes requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases. Software engineers use various tools, languages, and methodologies to develop software that meets the needs of users and organizations effectively.
